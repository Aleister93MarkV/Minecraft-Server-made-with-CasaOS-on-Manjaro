# The Minecraft Server made with the best, maybe worst case scenario depending on how you look at it.

## This is a Fully functional server made on CasaOS with Manjaro.

This repository can be served as both inspiration for those that want to build one
and as a devlog to the CasaOS Developers. Firstly, i've had a Core 2 Duo Laptop 
laying arround and, not having any use case for it, i've built a Home lab with it
and made three servers, First is the default file server that's included, Second
is a Jellyfin server, and the Third you've guest it, The Minecraft server, Built
using Crafty Controller with a few Plugins, plus with the Playit proxy
and to say that my experiences we're great is a testament to the fact that Manjaro 
was listed as a "Unsupported/Untested", allthough it gave me a few errors on install 
that i could not screenshot on time, it did indeed work, fine as that.

## Credits and Shoutouts to:

* The CasaOS Developers
* Playit.gg
* Jellyfin Developers
* and last but certenly not least Hardware Haven for the tutorial i've followed
